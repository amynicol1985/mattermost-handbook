# How to create release announcements

## **Goals**

* Get community excited about our momentum 
* Increase discovery of features and contributions 
* Make people feel AMAZING for contributing 
* Everything should be ready to share
  * Every paragraph feels like it's ready to copy and paste into a tweet. 
  * Every person we thank who is on Twitter, we Tweet to them

## **Process**

### T-20
* Release Manager prepares bullet points and release headline for release announcement. Release Manager to review the outline (benefits and order of major features) with PMs before sending to Justin to work on
* Decide which sections of the release announcement will have an accompanying screenshot/photo

### T-8
* Writer finishes blog post draft
* Release manager checks for spelling mistakes, features included, screenshot guidelines are met. Ask: how would you rate the title? How can we make it 1 score better? 
  - Use this method for other parts of the blog draft, inlcuding screenshots

### T-7
  * PMs review for features and content are technically correct
  * Marketing reviews

### T-6
* Head of PM reviews

### T-5
* CEO review
   - Release Manager to use hashtags in marketing channel (e.g. ``#mm520``) to make finding the blog draft easier, and post the blog draft in the marketing channel 24 hours prior to the meeting (and at-mention meeting attendees)
* Blog post published

### T+5
* Writer schedules tweets from blog post \(Tuesdays 10am PT, and Thursdays 10am if there's extra\)

## **Checklist for review of draft:**

The Release Manager \(Amy Blais\) owns the release announcement, including the following checklist items unless otherwise indicated:

1. **Exciting title**
   1. Do not lead with a competitor parity feature 
   2. Communicate primary benefit
   3. Lead with the most exciting/impactful new feature
   4. Highlight at most 2 features
     - Have clarity on why those 1-2 features were chosen for the title. Ask PMs to share specs or other details on why the features we are shipping were built
2. **Compelling, specific one-liners below hero image**
   1. Introduce features with compelling, concise, specific descriptions
   2. If the feature is a filler for a release, be vague and add it at the end of the blog post, e.g. "Performance improvements to mobile" **\(please avoid when possible\)**
   3. Beta features should be at the bottom of the list
   4. Lead with verbs (e.g. "Find most recent messages faster")
   5. Start with benefits, then technical details
3. **Body**
   1. Promote E10 and E20 features - add `E10` and `E20` labels throughout the blog post for relevant features
   2. No spelling errors or broken links
   3. All features PM team wants to highlight are included
      1. **\(PM team owns\)** Check for technical accuracy and statement of benefits 
   4. \(**Author owns\)** All contributors are recognized with a screenshot 
      1. Names should not be red-underlined \(if they are, add them to the dictionary prior to taking a screenshot\)
      2. Screenshot not surrounded by a border
      3. Below the screenshot, include a text version of their names in small font with a link to their GitHub handle
4. **Screenshots**
   1. [Follows screenshot guidelines](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/messaging-and-math/how-to-guides-for-m-and-m/how-to-create-screenshots-and-gifs)
   2. Do not use screenshots rated at low quality
      1. **\(Author owns\)** Rate each image High, Medium, Low quality
         1. **High** - Beautiful, highly compelling, grabs attention in a social stream 
         2. **Medium** - Tells a story clearly, readable text, right size 
         3. **Low** - Bare minimum to call an image 
   3. **\(Author owns\)** Draft Tweet text for all screenshots included
      1. Contains version hashtag, e.g. \#mm518

## **Style Guidelines**

1. Highlight past successes: Cross link to promote traffic 
2. Links tell a story: Links should indicate the content they lead to without clicking, avoid "read this blog post" and instead "learn more about the incident response alpha program"

## Screenshot Guidelines

[Learn how to create screenshots and GIFs](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/messaging-and-math/how-to-guides-for-m-and-m/how-to-create-screenshots-and-gifs)

## Language Guidelines
1. Specify Desktop app or Mobile App if a feature is not dependent on the server release
2. Use common wording, e.g. say "Servers" instead of "Sites"; say `plugins` not `plug-ins`; say "Browser" instead of "Webapp"
3. Avoid phrases like "Better messaging experience" that are too vague
4. Do not use internal names of features, such as "Unread toasts", "Deep linking"

## One great screenshot a month

1. Each monthly release R&D should aspire to come up with a "Hero" screenshot following guidelines to use as the splash image for the release.
2. Communicate primary benefit in the title
3. Keep the title short, use sentence case, and ensure there are no orphans or widows
4. If a screenshot isn't available to highlight in the release use a conceptual banner based on [R&D Twitter Banner Template](https://community.mattermost.com/files/6bc4cot5xbyi8cfxesgyx6aqdw/public?h=HKLm3FZvOvpylxVk7mUYmeaBQ_rFV_JCEAZ2w5z9fg4) \(shown below\)
